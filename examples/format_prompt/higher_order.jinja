You are an expert algorithm thinker. Given a problem, please provide a concise, high-level strategy without writing any code. 

Ensure your response is comprehensive and well-structured with clear steps and considerations.

Steps:
1. **Define the input-output structure**: Clearly specify the types and meanings of the input and output variables.
2. **Describe the solving logic** using:
   - **Sequence**: Step-by-step operations in the correct order.
   - **Branch**: Conditions (if / if-else) that lead to different solution paths.
   - **Loop**: Repetitive operations (for / while) needed to process the input.
3. **Key Considerations**: Identify any constraints, limitations, or potential pitfalls to keep in mind while solving the problem (e.g., time complexity, memory usage, edge cases, possilble errors to avoid). Provide solutions or optimizations where applicable.

Your response should provide a thorough strategy, avoid being overly concise, and include at least a few sentences for each step.

Example:
- **Input**:
  - **N** (an integer): The number of vertices in the graph.
  - **p** (a list of integers): A list of size N, where the i-th element, `p_i`, denotes the vertex that vertex i points to.
  
- **Output**:
  - Print "POSSIBLE" if a valid assignment exists, otherwise print "IMPOSSIBLE".

1. **Graph Construction**:
   1. Treat the given list `p` as a directed graph, where each vertex i points to `p_i`.
   2. The graph is essentially a **directed cycle structure** because each vertex has exactly one outgoing edge, forming a set of cycles.

2. **Identify Cycles**:
   1. Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) or Kosarajuâ€™s algorithm to find the **strongly connected components (SCCs)** in the graph.
   2. Each SCC will either be a cycle or a group of vertices that form a cycle structure.

3. **Assigning Values**:
   1. For each SCC:
      1. Assign a **unique value** to each vertex in the SCC.
      2. Ensure that for each cycle, the vertices get distinct values. This is necessary for the condition that for each `x < a_i`, there exists a vertex `j` such that `a_j = x`.

4. **Check Feasibility**:
   1. After assigning values, verify that there are **disjoint cycles**.
   2. Ensure that there are no overlapping assignments between vertices belonging to different cycles.
   3. If any cycle is connected improperly or the structure is too intertwined, mark the assignment as **IMPOSSIBLE**.

5. **Return Result**:
   1. If all cycles are successfully assigned values, print **"POSSIBLE"**.
   2. If it is impossible to assign values (due to overlapping cycles or conflicting connections), print **"IMPOSSIBLE"**.

### Step 3: **Key Considerations**

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The **SCC detection** using algorithms like Tarjan's or Kosaraju's runs in **O(N)** time.
   - Thus, the entire algorithm can be expected to run in **O(N)** time, which is optimal for the given problem constraints.

2. **Memory Usage**:
   - The space complexity primarily depends on the storage for the graph and the SCCs, leading to an **O(N)** space requirement.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The graph could consist of a single cycle (where every vertex points to exactly one other in a circular manner), which will be possible to assign distinct values.
   - If the graph has disconnected parts (not possible here since the graph is weakly connected), the solution might fail. But we are guaranteed weak connectivity, which simplifies the situation.

4. **Optimizations**:
   - Ensure that you can check cycles efficiently using union-find structures or DFS for SCCs.
   - Use efficient memory handling as the graph size can go up to 200,000 vertices.

5. **Possible Errors To Avoid**
   - ValueError: too many values to unpack:Ensure that each cycle or component is correctly unpacked or iterated over. For example, check the number of elements in a tuple or list before unpacking, and ensure that the number of values matches the expected structure.
   - IndexError: list index out of range: Carefully check that all vertex indices are within bounds. Ensure that the indices used to access the graph are valid (i.e., 0 <= i < N).
